## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 2 business days.

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will promptly triage and investigate the issue. We will maintain communication with the reporter throughout the process, providing updates on our progress and any necessary information.

If the vulnerability report is accepted, we will work to address the issue promptly and release a security update as soon as possible. Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will publicly acknowledge the reporter unless requested otherwise.

## Code Contributions

We welcome contributions to our project, but we also prioritize security in our development process. Here's how we handle security in code contributions:

1. **Security Review Process**: All contributions undergo a review process, including consideration of security implications. We conduct regular security reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Guidelines for Secure Contributions**: Contributors are encouraged to follow security best practices, including:
   - Validating user input
   - Sanitizing and escaping data
   - Using secure coding patterns and libraries
   - Avoiding known security pitfalls such as SQL injection and XSS attacks

3. **Code Review Process**: Code reviews include a focus on security, with reviewers actively looking for potential vulnerabilities. Contributors are encouraged to address any security-related feedback provided during code review.

4. **Reporting Security Issues in Contributions**: Contributors are expected to report any security issues they identify during the review process. This helps ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and transparently.

5. **Documentation**: Our documentation includes information on how contributors can contribute securely. This includes guidelines for secure coding practices and instructions for reporting security issues.

We appreciate the efforts of our contributors to help maintain the security of our project. By working together, we can create a safer environment for everyone.
